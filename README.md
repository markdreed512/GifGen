GifGen is a web app that allows users to search for a topic, which generates a button in the user's personal gif library.  When a button is pressed, 10 gifs of that topic are displayed.  Gifs are static by default, but can be clicked to animate.  To use a gif, users can copy and paste the gif URL that is generated for each gif.  

Local storage is utilized so each user's personal library will be available from session to session.
